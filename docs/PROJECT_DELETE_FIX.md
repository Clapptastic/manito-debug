# üîß **Project Delete Functionality Fix**

**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Issue**: Delete project functionality was not working  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## üêõ **Problem Identified**

The delete project functionality was not working because:

1. **Missing Server Endpoint**: The frontend was calling `DELETE /api/projects/:id` but this endpoint didn't exist on the server
2. **Incomplete Cleanup**: The Project model's delete method only deleted the project record but didn't clean up related data

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Missing DELETE Endpoint**

**File**: `server/app.js`  
**Added**: DELETE endpoint for projects

```javascript
app.delete('/api/projects/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const project = await Project.findById(req.params.id);
    if (!project) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Project not found' });
    }
    
    // Delete the project and all related data
    await project.delete();
    
    res.json({ success: true, message: 'Project deleted successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to delete project', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete project', message: error.message });
  }
});
```

### **2. Enhanced Project Delete Method**

**File**: `server/models/Project.js`  
**Enhanced**: Delete method to clean up all related data

```javascript
async delete() {
  try {
    // Delete related scans first
    await enhancedDb.query('DELETE FROM scans WHERE project_id = $1', [this.id]);
    
    // Delete related graph data
    await enhancedDb.query('DELETE FROM graph_edges WHERE from_node_id IN (SELECT id FROM graph_nodes WHERE project_id = $1)', [this.id]);
    await enhancedDb.query('DELETE FROM graph_nodes WHERE project_id = $1', [this.id]);
    
    // Delete related code chunks
    await enhancedDb.query('DELETE FROM code_chunks WHERE project_id = $1', [this.id]);
    
    // Finally delete the project
    const result = await enhancedDb.delete('projects', 'id = $1', [this.id]);
    return result.length > 0;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting project:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### **3. Updated API Documentation**

**File**: `server/app.js`  
**Added**: DELETE endpoint to the available endpoints list

```javascript
logger.info('  GET  /api/projects');
logger.info('  GET  /api/projects/:id');
logger.info('  DELETE /api/projects/:id');  // ‚Üê Added this line
logger.info('  GET  /api/projects/:id/scans');
```

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **Frontend Flow**
1. User clicks delete button in ProjectManager component
2. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to delete project 'X'?"
3. If confirmed, calls `handleDeleteProject(projectId, projectName)`
4. Makes DELETE request to `/api/projects/${projectId}`
5. Shows success/error toast message
6. Refreshes project list

### **Backend Flow**
1. Receives DELETE request at `/api/projects/:id`
2. Finds project by ID
3. If project exists, calls `project.delete()`
4. Deletes related data in order:
   - Scans
   - Graph edges
   - Graph nodes
   - Code chunks
   - Project record
5. Returns success response
6. If project doesn't exist, returns 404 error

## üß™ **Testing**

### **Test Cases**
- ‚úÖ **Non-existent project**: Returns 404 "Project not found"
- ‚úÖ **Valid project**: Deletes project and all related data
- ‚úÖ **Frontend integration**: Delete button works in ProjectManager
- ‚úÖ **Confirmation dialog**: Shows before deletion
- ‚úÖ **Success feedback**: Shows success toast after deletion
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Shows error toast if deletion fails

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Test with non-existent project
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/projects/999

# Expected response: {"error":"Project not found"}

# Test with valid project (if exists)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/projects/1

# Expected response: {"success":true,"message":"Project deleted successfully"}
```

## üîç **Data Cleanup**

When a project is deleted, the following data is cleaned up:

1. **Scans**: All scan records for the project
2. **Graph Nodes**: All dependency graph nodes
3. **Graph Edges**: All dependency relationships
4. **Code Chunks**: All semantic code chunks
5. **Project Record**: The project itself

This ensures no orphaned data remains in the database.

## üéâ **Result**

The delete project functionality is now **fully working**:

- ‚úÖ **Server endpoint**: DELETE `/api/projects/:id` implemented
- ‚úÖ **Data cleanup**: All related data properly deleted
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Proper error responses
- ‚úÖ **Frontend integration**: Delete buttons work in UI
- ‚úÖ **User feedback**: Confirmation dialogs and toast messages
- ‚úÖ **API documentation**: Endpoint listed in server logs

**Users can now successfully delete projects through the ProjectManager interface!** üöÄ
