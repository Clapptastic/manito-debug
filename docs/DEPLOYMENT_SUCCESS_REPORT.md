**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Environment**: Local Development + GitHub CI/CD Pipeline

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Redis Security Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: 
```
1:M 20 Aug 2025 22:30:08.961 # Possible SECURITY ATTACK detected. It looks like somebody is sending POST or Host: commands to Redis.
```

**Solution**:
- Added Redis authentication with password protection
- Updated Redis configuration in both development and production environments
- Added security settings to prevent cross-protocol scripting attacks
- Updated Redis URLs to include authentication credentials

**Files Modified**:
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Added Redis security configuration
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Added Redis security configuration
- Updated Redis URLs to: `redis://:manito_redis_password@redis:6379`

### 2. React Rendering Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**:
```
Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {/Users/andrewclapp/Desktop/ai debug planning/manito-package/client/src/main.jsx, ...})
```

**Solution**:
- Fixed data structure handling in `IntelligentMetricsVisualization` component
- Added proper validation for scan results data
- Updated `App.jsx` to pass correct metrics data structure
- Added fallback handling for different data formats

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/IntelligentMetricsVisualization.jsx` - Added data validation
- `client/src/App.jsx` - Fixed metrics data structure

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets
Navigate to your GitHub repository settings and add the following secrets:
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: For security vulnerability scanning
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: For Railway deployment (if using Railway)
- `RAILWAY_SERVICE`: Railway service name
- `RAILWAY_URL`: Railway deployment URL
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: For Docker Hub integration (optional)
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username (optional)

### 2. Set Up Environments
1. Go to GitHub repository Settings → Environments
2. Create `staging` environment for develop branch
3. Create `production` environment for main branch
4. Configure protection rules and required reviewers

### 3. Configure Branch Protection
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add protection rules for `main` and `develop` branches
3. Require status checks to pass before merging
4. Require pull request reviews

### 4. Monitor CI/CD Pipeline
1. Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository
2. Monitor workflow execution and resolve any issues
3. Verify deployments to staging and production environments
